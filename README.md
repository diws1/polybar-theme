# polybar-theme

## How to use ?
In my case, I put them on my autostart file :
```
sudo nano ~/.xsessionrc
```
Then add this line :
```
# Panel
~/.config/polybar/themes/T1/launch.sh &
```
>[!NOTE]
>Don't forget to change the autostart file permission :
```
sudo chmod 755 ~/.config/polybar/themes/T1/launch.sh &
```
